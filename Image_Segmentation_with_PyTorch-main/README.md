# Image_Segmentation_with_PyTorch

Image segmentation is an important subject in computer vision. It is the process of dividing an image into different regions based on the characteristics of pixels to identify objects or boundaries to simplify an image and more efficiently analyze it.

My project is about segmenting objects in an image. 
This project's model is based on a pretrained model 'timm-efficientnet-b0'
