# How KMeans Clustering Works
KMeans Clustering is a popular and widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm partitions a dataset into 'k' number of clusters, where each cluster is represented by its centroid.

The algorithm works as follows:

1.	Initialize 'k' number of centroids randomly.
2.	Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3.	Compute the new centroid of each cluster.
4.	Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.


# Conclusion
This repository demonstrates how to implement and apply the KMeans Clustering algorithm in Python using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The algorithm is useful for partitioning a dataset into clusters based on similarity, which can be useful in many applications, including customer segmentation, image and pattern recognition, and more
